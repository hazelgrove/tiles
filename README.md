# tylr ![Build Status](https://github.com/hazelgrove/tylr/actions/workflows/deploy-branches.yml/badge.svg)

`tylr` is a tiny interactive demonstration of tile-based editing,
a new kind of structure editing that, like text, supports
linear token-level editing workflows but, unlike text, ensures
your manipulated tokens can always be parsed back into a
well-formed syntax tree. 

You can try `tylr` online by visiting [tylr.fun](https://tylr.fun).
Click on the help button in the upper-right corner for a gif-laden
Twitter thread on how it works.
